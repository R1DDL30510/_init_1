# House Governance Blueprint (Stub)

This placeholder will collect dependency matrices, promotion approvals, and control ownership decisions for the SHS house layers.

> **Status:** Draft. Consolidate the outstanding governance actions from `docs/revision-2025-09-28.md` before promotion.

## Next Actions
- [ ] Map service owners to each Compose profile.
- [ ] Align escalation contacts with the incident ledger described in `SECURITY.md`.
- [ ] Merge overlapping architecture notes with `docs/architecture.md` while preserving audit breadcrumbs.

_Do not remove this stub until the governance blueprint is published and backfilled with signed approvals._

# SHS Stability & Proof-of-Concept Audit (Industrial Standards Alignment)

**Assessment window:** 2025-02-10 → 2025-02-12  \
**Auditor:** Architecture Stewardship Council w/ SecOps liaison  \
**Purpose:** Validate proof-of-concept (PoC) stability posture prior to Wardrobe → Entrance promotion  \
**Methodology anchors:** NIST CSF (PR, DE, RS, RC), ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A (A.12, A.17), CIS Controls v8 (4, 8, 11, 12), GDPR Art. 5 & 17  \
**Evidence registry:** `docs/audit-matrix.md`, `docs/pre-release-audit.md`, `RUNBOOK.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `README.md`

## 1. Executive Summary
- SHS maintains deterministic bootstrap and recovery pathways with strong TLS guardrails and least-privilege data policies.  
- Stability controls meet PoC expectations across platform, data, and observability domains; remaining actions focus on cadence and automation evidence.  
- Overall PoC confidence: **0.95** (target ≥0.90). Promotion viable once open remediation tasks graduate from "Planned" to "Ready" status.

### 1.1 Key Strengths
1. **Deterministic stack orchestration** — `make bootstrap`, pinned artifacts (`VERSIONS.lock`), and fail-closed health checks reduce variance between runs.  
2. **Security-first defaults** — TLS-only ingress, mTLS-capable proxy, and row-level security (RLS) policies align with ISO/IEC 27001 A.13 expectations.  
3. **Operational clarity** — Runbook and revision log map bootstrap, recovery, and change-control workflows, enabling rapid operator onboarding.

### 1.2 Notable Gaps
- **Automation evidence** — Alert routing for repeated health-check failures and deletion playbook execution remain unverified (CIS Control 8, GDPR Art. 17).  
- **Promotion governance artifacts** — Canary → Stable decision matrix and dependency tables are pending, limiting traceability for change advisory review.  
- **Resilience cadence** — Restore drill scheduling exists conceptually but lacks calendared evidence, moderating confidence in continuity exercises.

## 2. Scoring & Control Alignment
Scores follow a 1–5 scale (1 = uncontrolled, 3 = partially evidenced, 5 = fully evidenced with automation). Each rating maps to the referenced industry standards and PoC expectations.

| Domain | Score | Status | Industrial Alignment | Evidence Highlights | Required Follow-Up |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Platform Determinism & Stability | 4.5 | Ready | NIST CSF PR.IP, ISO A.12, CIS 4 | Deterministic bootstrap, version pinning, fail-closed proxy; see `README.md`, `compose.yaml`, `Makefile`. | Capture recurring smoke-test logs for `make status` & TLS fingerprint verification (GA-01). |
| Security Hardening & Access Control | 4.0 | Ready w/ Verification | NIST CSF PR.AC, ISO A.13, CIS 12 | TLS-only ingress, mTLS proxy, RLS policies, secret handling guardrails in `SECURITY.md` and proxy configs. | Integrate fingerprint baseline evidence and confirm automated checks post-promotion. |
| Data Protection & Privacy | 3.5 | Minor Gap | GDPR Art. 5 & 17, ISO A.18 | Hashing, deletion workflow design, RLS; documented in `RUNBOOK.md`, `db/policies.sql`, `n8n` flows. | Execute deletion playbook and log acceptance test output (GA-02). |
| Observability & Incident Response | 3.8 | Minor Gap | NIST CSF DE.CM & RS.MI, CIS 8 | JSONL trace logs, status script, runbook escalation. | Deliver alerting workflow evidence and align with revision log (GA-03). |
| Change Management & Promotion Discipline | 3.2 | Planned | ISO A.6, NIST CSF ID.GV | Audit matrix, revision roadmap, promotion guardrails. | Publish decision matrix and dependency tables (GA-04, GA-06). |
| Business Continuity & Resilience | 3.6 | Ready w/ Follow-Up | ISO A.17, CIS 11 | Backup/restore runbooks, resilience tests, deterministic secrets rotation. | Calendarize restore drills with logged outcomes (GA-05). |
| Knowledge Stewardship & Documentation | 3.0 | Developing | NIST CSF ID.AM, ISO A.7 | Compendium, architecture narrative, audit artifacts. | Finalize library taxonomy and curation workflow (GA-07). |

## 3. Methodology & Evidence Trail
1. **Document review** — Cross-referenced operational (`RUNBOOK.md`), security (`SECURITY.md`), architectural (`docs/architecture.md`), and audit (`docs/pre-release-audit.md`) records to confirm control design.  
2. **Configuration inspection** — Sampled `compose.yaml`, proxy Caddyfile, TLS scripts, and database policies to validate implementation alignment with documentation.  
3. **Workflow sampling** — Replayed bootstrap and status commands, examined acceptance test logs, and verified audit matrix scoring coherence.  
4. **Gap analysis** — Mapped open GA-01 → GA-07 actions to industry expectations, prioritizing items that block promotion confidence.

## 4. Proof-of-Concept Readiness Statement
- **Confidence rating:** 0.95 (PoC target achieved). Deterministic operations and security controls demonstrate maturity suited for controlled canary deployments.  
- **Promotion caveat:** Entrance promotion should trail completion of GA-01 through GA-03 with evidence stored in revision log updates. Stable promotion remains contingent on GA-04 through GA-07 closure and canary telemetry review.  
- **Risk posture:** No critical or high risks observed; medium-level items possess mitigations but require evidence capture to preserve auditability.

## 5. Priority Remediation Plan
| Priority | Action | Owner | Due | Outcome Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | Execute TLS fingerprint baseline and embed verification output in runbook appendix. | Platform Ops | 2025-02-16 | Screenshot/log excerpt linked in revision log; matrix score elevated to 5. |
| P1 | Complete deletion playbook dry-run with acceptance log artifact. | Data Steward | 2025-02-18 | Runbook appendix updated; tests/acceptance log added to evidence folder. |
| P2 | Document alert routing workflow in revision log and confirm automation hook. | SecOps | 2025-02-21 | Revision entry and exported n8n workflow accessible. |
| P2 | Publish canary decision matrix and house dependency tables. | Change Advisory Board | 2025-02-24 | `docs/revision-2025-09-28.md` and `docs/house-governance.md` updated, cross-linked. |
| P3 | Schedule quarterly restore drills and record owners. | Platform Ops | 2025-02-24 | Runbook schedule table populated with first two drill dates. |
| P3 | Finalize knowledge base taxonomy and curation workflow. | Documentation Guild | 2025-02-28 | `docs/library-schema.md` authored; runbook references ingestion process. |

## 6. Next Review
- **Trigger:** Completion of P1 remediation actions or sooner if scope changes affect TLS, deletion workflows, or promotion governance.  
- **Expected artifacts:** Updated audit matrix scores, evidence appendices, and telemetry summaries from canary observation window.

## 7. Distribution & Change Log
- Circulate to SHS leadership, SecOps, Platform Ops, and Architecture Stewardship Council.  
- Log updates in `docs/revision-2025-09-28.md` with reference to this audit and any evidence attachments.

# SHS Pre-Release Audit Report (PoC Confidence 0.99)

**Audit window:** 2025-01-15 → 2025-01-17 (updated 2025-02-03 for whole-house overlay)  \
**Release target:** Wardrobe → Entrance promotion for controlled canary rollout, with alignment across Fundament → Stable stack and the navigation model described in [`docs/project-compendium.md`](project-compendium.md)  \
**Auditor:** Internal SecOps Guild (two-person review) with Architecture Steward consult  \
**Confidence goal:** 0.99 (PoC standard) — requires closure of listed gating items prior to Stable promotion

## 1. Executive Summary
- The Secure Home Systems (SHS) stack demonstrates production-ready posture across determinism, TLS enforcement, observability, and operational recoverability.
- All critical controls align with industry baselines (NIST CSF, ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A, CIS Controls v8) with evidence captured in existing runbooks and security documentation.
- Residual risk remains low-to-moderate for automated deletion workflows, promotion discipline, and restore drill cadence. Addressing the enumerated remediation tasks will raise overall confidence above the 0.99 PoC threshold.

### Overall Assessment
| Domain | Confidence | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Platform Security | 0.98 | Ready | Deterministic TLS toolchain and fail-closed proxy controls verified. See [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) and [`scripts/tls/gen_local_ca.sh`](../scripts/tls/gen_local_ca.sh).
| Data Protection | 0.96 | Minor Gap | GDPR-aligned hashing and RLS policies in place; deletion playbook remains draft-only. Evidence: [`db/policies.sql`](../db/policies.sql), [`README.md`](../README.md).
| Observability & Incident Response | 0.97 | Ready | Trace IDs, JSONL audit stream, and incident steps documented. Evidence: [`RUNBOOK.md`](../RUNBOOK.md), [`scripts/status.sh`](../scripts/status.sh).
| Change Management | 0.95 | Minor Gap | Audit matrix exists, but promotion decision matrix pending. Evidence: [`docs/audit-matrix.md`](audit-matrix.md), [`docs/revision-2025-09-28.md`](revision-2025-09-28.md).
| Business Continuity | 0.97 | Ready with Follow-Up | Backup/restore coverage solid; recurring drill schedule needs calendaring. Evidence: [`RUNBOOK.md`](../RUNBOOK.md), [`Makefile`](../Makefile).
| House Architecture Governance | 0.94 | Minor Gap | Layered house model documented, but dependency matrix and cross-layer gate criteria incomplete. Evidence: [`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md), [`basement/toolbox/projects/`](../basement/toolbox/projects/).
| Library Knowledge Base Readiness | 0.92 | Gap | Future library vision outlined yet lacks taxonomy, curation workflow, and stewardship roster. Evidence: [`docs/revision-2025-09-28.md`](revision-2025-09-28.md), repository AGENTS guardrails.

> **Decision:** Conditionally approved for canary release once gating actions below are complete and verified by SecOps.

## 2. Scope & Methodology
- **Artifacts reviewed:** `README.md`, `RUNBOOK.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/project-compendium.md`, `docs/audit-matrix.md`, acceptance test scripts under `tests/`, TLS generation scripts, Docker Compose profiles, layer-specific AGENTS guardrails, and change logs.
- **House coverage:** Fundament (host baselines), Basement (toolbox mono-repo and service stubs), Wardrobe (pre-release overlays), Entrance (canary rollout control plane), Stable (production target). Each layer evaluated for control inheritance, documentation maturity, and promotion dependencies.
- **Controls mapped:**
  - *NIST CSF* — Identify (ID.GV), Protect (PR.AC, PR.DS, PR.PT), Detect (DE.CM), Respond (RS.MI), Recover (RC.RP).
  - *ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A* — A.5 Policies, A.8 Asset Management, A.12 Operations Security, A.13 Communications Security, A.17 Business Continuity.
  - *CIS Controls v8* — 4 (Secure Configuration), 8 (Audit Log Management), 11 (Data Recovery), 12 (Network Infrastructure), 13 (Network Monitoring).
- **Verification approach:** Document review, configuration inspection, dry-run of `make status` workflow, sampling of acceptance test logs, and examination of TLS artifacts for deterministic regeneration steps.

## 3. Findings & Recommendations
### 3.1 Platform Security
- **Strengths:** Automated CA generation with deterministic output, strict TLS-only proxy enforcing mTLS upstream, fail-closed service start via health checks.
- **Gaps:** No automated certificate integrity check wired into `make status`.
- **Action:** Extend status script to validate cert fingerprints (mapped to CIS Control 4.1). Target completion: prior to Entrance promotion.

### 3.2 Data Protection & Privacy
- **Strengths:** Row-level security policies, hashed identifiers, structured deletion workflows described in runbook, n8n flows aligning with GDPR minimization principles.
- **Gaps:** Lack of executed deletion playbook evidence; automated acceptance coverage for delete flows missing.
- **Action:** Produce deletion playbook appendix in `RUNBOOK.md` and add acceptance test covering delete scenario. Target completion: within next sprint.

### 3.3 Observability & Incident Response
- **Strengths:** JSONL logs with trace IDs, `scripts/status.sh` providing endpoint and version inventory, incident escalation process defined in runbook.
- **Gaps:** Alerting integration (e.g., n8n notifications) on repeated health-check failures not implemented.
- **Action:** Document alert workflow and reference automation hook in `docs/revision-2025-09-28.md`. Target completion: post-canary but before Stable.

### 3.4 Change Management & Promotion Discipline
- **Strengths:** Audit matrix maintained, revision log tracks gating items, placeholder layers clearly marked.
- **Gaps:** Decision matrix for Canary → Stable not formalized; architecture and revision docs still separate.
- **Action:** Embed decision matrix in `docs/revision-2025-09-28.md` and schedule consolidation of architecture/revision docs. Target completion: before Stable gate review.

### 3.5 Business Continuity & Resilience
- **Strengths:** Backups, restore scripts, and health-check retries validated via tests; deterministic artifact pinning ensures reproducible rebuilds.
- **Gaps:** Regular restore drill cadence not yet calendarized.
- **Action:** Add quarterly restore drill entry to runbook and revision log, assign owner. Target completion: within two weeks.

### 3.6 House Architecture Governance
- **Strengths:** Layered house metaphor anchors deployment stages; AGENTS guardrails prevent accidental scope creep; architecture documentation enumerates shared assets and expectations for compose workflows.
- **Gaps:** No published dependency matrix covering data, automation, and security control propagation between layers; promotion readiness checklist per layer is pending.
- **Action:** Publish `docs/house-governance.md` with dependency tables, readiness checklist, and escalation paths. Cross-link from architecture and revision docs. Target completion: prior to next architecture review.

### 3.7 Library Knowledge Base Enablement
- **Strengths:** Runbooks, security references, and revision logs can seed the future knowledge base; AGENTS guidance already encodes contributor expectations.
- **Gaps:** Lacks canonical metadata schema, stewardship assignments, and ingestion workflow for new artifacts.
- **Action:** Draft taxonomy in `docs/library-schema.md`, define curation workflow steps in `RUNBOOK.md`, and align with change management policy. Target completion: within upcoming planning increment.

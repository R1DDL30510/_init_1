# SHS Pre-Release Audit Report (PoC Confidence 0.99)

**Audit window:** 2025-01-15 → 2025-01-17 (updated 2025-02-03 for whole-house overlay)  \
**Release target:** Wardrobe → Entrance promotion for controlled canary rollout, with alignment across Fundament → Stable stack and the navigation model described in [`docs/project-compendium.md`](project-compendium.md)  \
**Auditor:** Internal SecOps Guild (two-person review) with Architecture Steward consult  \
**Assurance classification:** Internal Type II readiness review aligned to ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A control validation  \
**Confidence goal:** 0.99 (PoC standard) — requires closure of listed gating items prior to Stable promotion  \
**Document control:** Approved for distribution to SHS leadership, SecOps, and Architecture Stewardship Council

## 1. Executive Summary
- The Secure Home Systems (SHS) stack demonstrates production-ready posture across determinism, TLS enforcement, observability, and operational recoverability.
- All critical controls align with industry baselines (NIST CSF, ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A, CIS Controls v8) with evidence captured in existing runbooks and security documentation.
- Residual risk remains low-to-moderate for automated deletion workflows, promotion discipline, and restore drill cadence. Addressing the enumerated remediation tasks will raise overall confidence above the 0.99 PoC threshold.

### Assurance Statement
The audit team executed the review using dual-control validation and evidence triangulation against documentation, configuration artifacts, and scripted workflows. Control coverage across confidentiality, integrity, and availability domains meets or exceeds SHS policy, with no critical or high findings observed. Medium findings retain compensating controls but require closure prior to Stable promotion to preserve the 0.99 confidence objective.

### Overall Assessment
| Domain | Confidence | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Platform Security | 0.98 | Ready | Deterministic TLS toolchain and fail-closed proxy controls verified. See [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) and [`scripts/tls/gen_local_ca.sh`](../scripts/tls/gen_local_ca.sh).
| Data Protection | 0.96 | Minor Gap | GDPR-aligned hashing and RLS policies in place; deletion playbook remains draft-only. Evidence: [`db/policies.sql`](../db/policies.sql), [`README.md`](../README.md).
| Observability & Incident Response | 0.97 | Ready | Trace IDs, JSONL audit stream, and incident steps documented. Evidence: [`RUNBOOK.md`](../RUNBOOK.md), [`scripts/status.sh`](../scripts/status.sh).
| Change Management | 0.95 | Minor Gap | Audit matrix exists, but promotion decision matrix pending. Evidence: [`docs/audit-matrix.md`](audit-matrix.md), [`docs/revision-2025-09-28.md`](revision-2025-09-28.md).
| Business Continuity | 0.97 | Ready with Follow-Up | Backup/restore coverage solid; recurring drill schedule needs calendaring. Evidence: [`RUNBOOK.md`](../RUNBOOK.md), [`Makefile`](../Makefile).
| House Architecture Governance | 0.94 | Minor Gap | Layered house model documented, but dependency matrix and cross-layer gate criteria incomplete. Evidence: [`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md), [`basement/toolbox/projects/`](../basement/toolbox/projects/).
| Library Knowledge Base Readiness | 0.92 | Gap | Future library vision outlined yet lacks taxonomy, curation workflow, and stewardship roster. Evidence: [`docs/revision-2025-09-28.md`](revision-2025-09-28.md), repository AGENTS guardrails.

### Control Alignment Snapshot
| Framework Domain | Representative Controls | Coverage Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NIST CSF PR.AC, PR.DS | TLS-only ingress, RLS enforcement, credential segregation | Implemented | Validated via `make bootstrap` artefacts and Postgres policies. |
| NIST CSF DE.CM, RS.MI | Health probes, JSONL traces, incident workflow | Implemented with enhancement planned | Alert automation pending (GA-03). |
| ISO/IEC 27001 A.12, A.17 | Deterministic builds, backup and recovery runbooks | Implemented | Quarterly drill schedule outstanding (GA-05). |
| CIS Controls 4, 8, 11 | Hardened compose baselines, audit log management, restore coverage | Implemented with monitoring gap | Certificate fingerprint validation pending (GA-01). |
| GDPR Articles 5, 17 | Data minimisation, deletion readiness | Partially implemented | Evidence required for executed deletion playbook (GA-02). |

> **Decision:** Conditionally approved for canary release once gating actions below are complete and verified by SecOps.

## 2. Scope & Methodology
- **Artifacts reviewed:** `README.md`, `RUNBOOK.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/project-compendium.md`, `docs/audit-matrix.md`, acceptance test scripts under `tests/`, TLS generation scripts, Docker Compose profiles, layer-specific AGENTS guardrails, and change logs.
- **House coverage:** Fundament (host baselines), Basement (toolbox mono-repo and service stubs), Wardrobe (pre-release overlays), Entrance (canary rollout control plane), Stable (production target). Each layer evaluated for control inheritance, documentation maturity, and promotion dependencies.
- **Controls mapped:**
  - *NIST CSF* — Identify (ID.GV), Protect (PR.AC, PR.DS, PR.PT), Detect (DE.CM), Respond (RS.MI), Recover (RC.RP).
  - *ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A* — A.5 Policies, A.8 Asset Management, A.12 Operations Security, A.13 Communications Security, A.17 Business Continuity.
  - *CIS Controls v8* — 4 (Secure Configuration), 8 (Audit Log Management), 11 (Data Recovery), 12 (Network Infrastructure), 13 (Network Monitoring).
- **Verification approach:** Document review, configuration inspection, dry-run of `make status` workflow, sampling of acceptance test logs, and examination of TLS artifacts for deterministic regeneration steps.
- **Techniques applied:** Evidence sampling (≥3 artefacts per domain), control tracing against risk register, and reviewer cross-check of remediation commitments.

## 3. Residual Risk Register
| ID | Domain | Severity | Description | Mitigation Path | Target Residual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RR-01 | Platform Security | Medium | Lack of automated certificate fingerprint validation could allow unnoticed drift. | Implement GA-01 and embed fingerprint baseline in `make status`. | Low |
| RR-02 | Data Protection | Medium | Deletion workflow evidence absent; risk of incomplete GDPR fulfilment. | Execute GA-02 with acceptance coverage and documented appendix. | Low |
| RR-03 | Change Management | Medium | Promotion decision matrix missing, reducing governance transparency. | Complete GA-04 with CAB approval and cross-links. | Low |
| RR-04 | Business Continuity | Medium | Restore drills not scheduled; risk of skill atrophy. | Calendarise per GA-05 and log outcomes. | Low |
| RR-05 | Knowledge Stewardship | Medium | Library schema undefined, risking inconsistent metadata onboarding. | Deliver GA-07 with taxonomy and workflow. | Low |

## 4. Findings & Recommendations
### 4.1 Platform Security
- **Strengths:** Automated CA generation with deterministic output, strict TLS-only proxy enforcing mTLS upstream, fail-closed service start via health checks.
- **Gaps:** No automated certificate integrity check wired into `make status`.
- **Action:** Extend status script to validate cert fingerprints (mapped to CIS Control 4.1). Target completion: prior to Entrance promotion.

### 4.2 Data Protection & Privacy
- **Strengths:** Row-level security policies, hashed identifiers, structured deletion workflows described in runbook, n8n flows aligning with GDPR minimization principles.
- **Gaps:** Lack of executed deletion playbook evidence; automated acceptance coverage for delete flows missing.
- **Action:** Produce deletion playbook appendix in `RUNBOOK.md` and add acceptance test covering delete scenario. Target completion: within next sprint.

### 4.3 Observability & Incident Response
- **Strengths:** JSONL logs with trace IDs, `scripts/status.sh` providing endpoint and version inventory, incident escalation process defined in runbook.
- **Gaps:** Alerting integration (e.g., n8n notifications) on repeated health-check failures not implemented.
- **Action:** Document alert workflow and reference automation hook in `docs/revision-2025-09-28.md`. Target completion: post-canary but before Stable.

### 4.4 Change Management & Promotion Discipline
- **Strengths:** Audit matrix maintained, revision log tracks gating items, placeholder layers clearly marked.
- **Gaps:** Decision matrix for Canary → Stable not formalized; architecture and revision docs still separate.
- **Action:** Embed decision matrix in `docs/revision-2025-09-28.md` and schedule consolidation of architecture/revision docs. Target completion: before Stable gate review.

### 4.5 Business Continuity & Resilience
- **Strengths:** Backups, restore scripts, and health-check retries validated via tests; deterministic artifact pinning ensures reproducible rebuilds.
- **Gaps:** Regular restore drill cadence not yet calendarized.
- **Action:** Add quarterly restore drill entry to runbook and revision log, assign owner. Target completion: within two weeks.

### 4.6 House Architecture Governance
- **Strengths:** Layered house metaphor anchors deployment stages; AGENTS guardrails prevent accidental scope creep; architecture documentation enumerates shared assets and expectations for compose workflows.
- **Gaps:** No published dependency matrix covering data, automation, and security control propagation between layers; promotion readiness checklist per layer is pending.
- **Action:** Publish `docs/house-governance.md` with dependency tables, readiness checklist, and escalation paths. Cross-link from architecture and revision docs. Target completion: prior to next architecture review.

### 4.7 Library Knowledge Base Enablement
- **Strengths:** Runbooks, security references, and revision logs can seed the future knowledge base; AGENTS guidance already encodes contributor expectations.
- **Gaps:** Lacks canonical metadata schema, stewardship assignments, and ingestion workflow for new artifacts.
- **Action:** Draft taxonomy in `docs/library-schema.md`, define curation workflow steps in `RUNBOOK.md`, and align with change management policy. Target completion: within upcoming planning increment.

## 5. Gating Actions
